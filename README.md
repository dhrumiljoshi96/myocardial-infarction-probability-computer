This project will help us anticipate a person's risk of a heart attack.
To forecast the outcome and determine which algorithm works best, several Algorithms are utilised. The results are then predicted using Auto ML Library EVAL ML.

Steps:

1) Data Examination
2) Feature Development
3) Standardisation
4) Model Construction
5) Projections


For our projections, we shall employ the models listed below: 

1) Logistic Regression
2) Decision Tree
3) Random Forest
4) K Nearest Neighbour
5) SVM
